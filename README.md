# 🌐 PAXECT — The Universal Deterministic Bridge
Build once, run anywhere. Connect all operating systems and programming languages through one reproducible, offline-first runtime.

---

## 🧩 Deterministic Runtime
PAXECT Core guarantees **predictable, bit-identical results** across any platform.  
Each `.freq` container validates its data with CRC32 and SHA-256, ensuring full end-to-end integrity.  
Ideal for research, automation, and reproducible CI/CD pipelines where consistency truly matters.

**Keywords:** deterministic-runtime, reproducible-pipelines, bit-identical, offline-first, data-integrity, verifiable-workflows

---

## 🌐 Cross-Language & Multi-OS Bridge
Run one pipeline across Linux, macOS, Windows — or even Android & iOS — without rewriting code.  
Through the **Polyglot Bridge**, PAXECT connects Python, Node.js, Go and other runtimes in the same deterministic loop.  
It’s the universal connector between operating systems and programming languages.

**Keywords:** cross-os, cross-language, polyglot-bridge, multi-environment, hybrid-runtime, system-integration

## 🔐 Security & Compliance
Security and privacy are built-in — not added later.  
Using the **AEAD Hybrid** module, every frame is encrypted and authenticated while remaining reproducible.  
Offline operation and transparent audits make PAXECT Core aligned with **NIS2** and upcoming **Digital Hygiene 2027** standards.

**Keywords:** aead-hybrid, encryption, privacy-by-design, nis2-compliance, audit-ready, zero-telemetry

## 🧠 About PAXECT Systems
**PAXECT Systems** develops reproducible, privacy-first infrastructure for the next generation of software ecosystems.  
Our mission: make every computation verifiable — across any operating system, language, or hardware.  
We believe deterministic software is the foundation of **digital hygiene**, transparency, and long-term trust in automation.

### 🧩 What We Stand For
- **Determinism first:** identical results across OSes and languages  
- **Privacy by default:** no telemetry, no analytics, no tracking  
- **Open collaboration:** transparent governance and verifiable builds  
- **Sustainability:** fair, open-source model with enterprise support

### 🧾 Author & Governance
PAXECT is maintained by the **PAXECT-Interface collective**, led by the project Owner and supported by community contributors.  
All merges and architectural decisions follow deterministic CI checks and responsible review policies.
